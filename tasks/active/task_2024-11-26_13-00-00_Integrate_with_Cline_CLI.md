# Integrate with Cline VSCode Extension

## Progress Update

### Completed âœ“
1. Core Integration
- VSCode extension detection
- Tool request parsing
- Safety analysis
- History management
- Event system

2. Tool Execution
- Command execution with safety checks
- File operations with path handling
- File listing with recursive support
- File search with context lines
- Browser control with screenshots

3. Testing
- Extension detection tests
- Tool request handling tests
- Safety analysis tests
- Event system tests
- Tool execution tests
- Browser control tests

### In Progress
1. System Integration
- [ ] Connect monitor to executor
- [ ] Add approval flow
- [ ] Handle responses
- [ ] Add logging

2. Error Recovery
- [ ] Handle extension errors
- [ ] Handle tool errors
- [ ] Handle browser errors
- [ ] Add recovery strategies

### Next Steps
1. Integration Flow

- [ ] Parse tool requests
- [ ] Execute tools safely
- [ ] Return results

2. Error Handling
- [ ] Add error recovery
- [ ] Improve logging
- [ ] Add retries
- [ ] Handle cleanup

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
1. Components:
- VSCodeIntegration: Core integration with VSCode
- ExtensionMonitor: Monitors extension events
- ToolExecutor: Executes tool requests
- BrowserControl: Handles browser actions

2. Tool Flow:
```
Extension -> Monitor -> Parser -> Safety Check -> Executor -> Response
```

3. Safety Rules:
- Block dangerous commands (rm, sudo)
- Validate file paths (no ../ or /)
- Safe defaults for unknown tools
- History tracking for approvals

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
- Extension detection
- Tool request parsing
- Safety analysis
- History management

2. Integration Tests:
- Event monitoring
- Tool execution
- Browser control
- Error handling

3. System Tests:
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance testing
- Error scenarios
- Recovery testing

## Notes
- Extension found at ~/.vscode/extensions/saoudrizwan.claude-dev-2.1.6.backup
- Uses XML format for tool requests
- Requires approval for each tool use
- Maintains history of approvals
- Event-based architecture for flexibility
- Safety first approach with strict rules
- Tool execution working with comprehensive tests
- Browser control working with screenshots
- Error handling needs improvement
