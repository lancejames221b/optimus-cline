## Implementation Details

### Tool Request Format
```xml
<tool_name>
<param1>value1</param1>
<param2>value2</param2>
</tool_name>
```

### Safety Rules
1. Blocked Commands:
- rm, sudo, mv
- Pipe operators (|)
- Redirections (>, >>)

2. File Paths:
- No parent directory (..)
- No absolute paths (/)
- Within project only

3. Auto-Approval:
- Safe commands only
- Valid paths
- Known patterns

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
- Extension detection
- Tool request handling
- Safety analysis
- History management

2. Integration Tests:
- Extension communication
- Tool execution
- Error handling

3. System Tests:
- End-to-end workflows
- Real tool usage
- Performance testing

## Notes
- Extension found at ~/.vscode/extensions/saoudrizwan.claude-dev-2.1.6.backup
- Uses XML format for tool requests
- Requires approval for each tool use
- Maintains history of approvals
