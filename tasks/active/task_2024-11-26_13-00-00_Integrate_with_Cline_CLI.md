## Implementation Details

### Architecture
1. Components:
- VSCodeIntegration: Core integration with VSCode
- ExtensionMonitor: Monitors extension events
- ToolRequest: Represents tool use requests
- Event System: Handles tool events

2. Safety Rules:
- Block dangerous commands (rm, sudo)
- Validate file paths (no ../ or /)
- Safe defaults for unknown tools
- History tracking for approvals

3. Event Flow:
```
Extension Output -> Monitor -> Parser -> Safety Check -> Handler -> Response
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
- Extension detection
- Tool request parsing
- Safety analysis
- History management

2. Integration Tests:
- Event monitoring
- Tool execution
- Error handling
- Recovery strategies

3. System Tests:
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance testing
- Error scenarios
- Recovery testing

## Notes
- Extension found at ~/.vscode/extensions/saoudrizwan.claude-dev-2.1.6.backup
- Uses XML format for tool requests
- Requires approval for each tool use
- Maintains history of approvals
- Event-based architecture for flexibility
- Safety first approach with strict rules
