## Implementation Details

### Architecture
1. Components:
- VSCodeIntegration: Core integration with VSCode
- ExtensionMonitor: Monitors extension events
- ToolExecutor: Executes tool requests
- BrowserControl: Handles browser actions
- SystemIntegration: Connects all components
- ErrorRecovery: Handles error recovery
- RecoveryActions: Implements recovery strategies
- PerformanceMonitor: Tracks system metrics

2. Tool Flow:
```
Extension -> Monitor -> System -> Executor -> Response
```

3. Error Flow:
```
Error -> Recovery Strategy -> Recovery Action -> Retry/Cleanup
```

4. Monitoring Flow:
```
Operation -> Timing -> Metrics -> Storage -> Alerts
```

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
- Extension detection
- Tool request parsing
- Safety analysis
- History management
- Error recovery
- Performance monitoring

2. Integration Tests:
- Event monitoring
- Tool execution
- Browser control
- Error handling
- Recovery strategies
- Resource cleanup

3. System Tests:
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance testing
- Error scenarios
- Recovery testing
- Resource management

## Notes
- Extension found at ~/.vscode/extensions/saoudrizwan.claude-dev-2.1.6.backup
- Uses XML format for tool requests
- Requires approval for each tool use
- Maintains history of approvals
- Event-based architecture for flexibility
- Safety first approach with strict rules
- Tool execution working with comprehensive tests
- Browser control working with screenshots
- System integration working with event flow
- Error recovery working with retries
- Resource cleanup working properly
- Performance monitoring working with low overhead
- Documentation complete
- Ready for optimization phase
