# Integrate with Cline VSCode Extension

## Progress Update

### Completed âœ“
1. Core Integration
- VSCode extension detection
- Tool request parsing
- Safety analysis
- History management
- Event system

2. Tool Execution
- Command execution with safety checks
- File operations with path handling
- File listing with recursive support
- File search with context lines
- Browser control with screenshots

3. System Integration
- Monitor-executor connection
- Event-based communication
- Tool request handling
- Response propagation
- Error handling

4. Testing
- Extension detection tests
- Tool request handling tests
- Safety analysis tests
- Event system tests
- Tool execution tests
- Browser control tests
- System integration tests

### In Progress
1. Error Recovery
- [ ] Handle extension errors
- [ ] Handle tool errors
- [ ] Handle browser errors
- [ ] Add recovery strategies

2. Performance
- [ ] Optimize browser control
- [ ] Improve event handling
- [ ] Add caching
- [ ] Reduce latency

### Next Steps
1. Error Handling
- [ ] Add error recovery
- [ ] Improve logging
- [ ] Add retries
- [ ] Handle cleanup

2. Optimization
- [ ] Profile performance
- [ ] Identify bottlenecks
- [ ] Implement caching
- [ ] Optimize flows

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
1. Components:
- VSCodeIntegration: Core integration with VSCode
- ExtensionMonitor: Monitors extension events
- ToolExecutor: Executes tool requests
- BrowserControl: Handles browser actions
- SystemIntegration: Connects all components

2. Tool Flow:
```
Extension -> Monitor -> System -> Executor -> Response
```

3. Event Flow:
```
Tool Request -> Safety Check -> Execution -> Response -> Event
```

4. Safety Rules:
- Block dangerous commands (rm, sudo)
- Validate file paths (no ../ or /)
- Safe defaults for unknown tools
- History tracking for approvals

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit Tests:
- Extension detection
- Tool request parsing
- Safety analysis
- History management

2. Integration Tests:
- Event monitoring
- Tool execution
- Browser control
- Error handling

3. System Tests:
- End-to-end workflows
- Performance testing
- Error scenarios
- Recovery testing

## Notes
- Extension found at ~/.vscode/extensions/saoudrizwan.claude-dev-2.1.6.backup
- Uses XML format for tool requests
- Requires approval for each tool use
- Maintains history of approvals
- Event-based architecture for flexibility
- Safety first approach with strict rules
- Tool execution working with comprehensive tests
- Browser control working with screenshots
- System integration working with event flow
- Error handling needs improvement
- Performance optimization pending
