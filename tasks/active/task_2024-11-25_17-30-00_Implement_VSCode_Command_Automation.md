# Task: Implement VS Code Command Automation
Date: 2024-11-25_17-30-00

## System Prompt
Add VS Code command automation to the Cline GUI, allowing safe execution of VS Code commands through the interface.

## Task Rules
- [ ] Don't delete production systems
- [ ] Always backup before making changes
- [ ] Verify changes in staging first
- [ ] Follow security protocols
- [ ] Document all changes
- [ ] Implement safety guardrails
- [ ] Require confirmation for destructive actions
- [ ] Log all automated actions

## Implementation Plan

1. VS Code Command Integration
   ```python
   def execute_vscode_command(self, command, args=None):
       """Execute VS Code command via CLI"""
       cmd = ['code', '--command', command]
       if args:
           cmd.extend(['--args', json.dumps(args)])
       subprocess.run(cmd)
   ```

2. Common VS Code Commands
   ```python
   VSCODE_COMMANDS = {
       'accept_change': 'git.acceptChange',
       'stage_change': 'git.stage',
       'revert_change': 'git.revertChange',
       'commit': 'git.commit',
       'push': 'git.push'
   }
   ```

3. Safety Guardrails
   ```python
   def validate_command(self, command, context):
       """Validate command safety"""
       if command in ['revert_change', 'git.revertChange']:
           # Require explicit confirmation
           return messagebox.askyesno(
               "Confirm Revert",
               "Are you sure you want to revert this change?"
           )
       return True
   ```

4. UI Integration
   ```python
   def setup_vscode_ui(self):
       """Add VS Code controls"""
       vscode_frame = ttk.LabelFrame(
           text="VS Code Actions"
       )
       
       # Common actions
       ttk.Button(
           text="Accept Change",
           command=lambda: self.safe_execute_vscode('accept_change')
       )
       
       # Custom command input
       ttk.Entry(placeholder="Enter VS Code command")
   ```

## Required Features

1. Command Execution
   - Execute VS Code commands via CLI
   - Support common Git operations
   - Allow custom command input

2. Safety Features
   - Command validation
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Action logging
   - Undo capability

3. UI Integration
   - Quick action buttons
   - Command history
   - Status feedback

## Access Requirements
- SSH Config: N/A
- API Keys: N/A
- Permissions: Local VS Code installation

## Safety Checks
- [x] Production safeguards active
- [x] Backup systems verified (git)
- [x] Rollback plan tested
- [x] Access controls verified
- [x] Monitoring systems active

## Pre-Execution Checklist
- [x] Verified environment
- [x] Checked VS Code installation
- [x] Backed up relevant data
- [x] Reviewed previous tasks
- [x] Confirmed compliance with task rules

## Steps

1. Add VS Code Command Support
   ```python
   # Add VS Code command execution
   # Add safety validation
   # Add UI elements
   ```

2. Implement Safety Guardrails
   ```python
   # Add command validation
   # Add confirmation dialogs
   # Add logging system
   ```

3. Test Integration
   ```python
   # Test common commands
   # Test safety features
   # Test UI functionality
   ```

## Verification
1. Test Command Execution
   ```bash
   # Test VS Code commands
   # Verify safety checks
   ```

2. Test Safety Features
   ```bash
   # Test confirmations
   # Test logging
   ```

## Rollback
1. Git revert to last working state
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

## Results
- [ ] VS Code command execution implemented
- [ ] Safety guardrails in place
- [ ] UI integration complete
- [ ] All tests passing

## Notes
- Historical context: Adding automation to GUI
- Known issues: None yet
- Future improvements: Add command suggestions, keyboard shortcuts
- Rule violations: None
