# VS Code Command Automation Implementation

## Progress Summary

### Completed
- Created VS Code automation UI with:
  - Common actions buttons (Accept, Stage, Revert)
  - Custom command input
  - Button location setup
  - Auto-click toggle
  - Command history
- Added test dialog for capturing button colors
- Implemented color detection system
- Added configuration saving/loading
- Added debug info display
- Added error handling and logging
- Fixed widget initialization issues

### Issues Encountered
- Automated clicking not reliable enough
- Color detection needs improvement
- GUI initialization has some issues

### Next Steps
1. Research alternative methods for button detection
2. Consider using VS Code extension API instead of GUI automation
3. Fix remaining GUI initialization issues
4. Add better error handling for automation
5. Improve configuration management

## Technical Notes

### Button Detection
Currently using pixel color detection which has proven unreliable. Need to explore:
- VS Code extension API for direct command execution
- Accessibility APIs for better UI element detection
- Window system APIs for more reliable automation

### Configuration
Currently saving:
- Button locations
- Color settings
- Automation preferences
per project in .cline/vscode_config.json

### Dependencies
- pyautogui for screen interaction
- tkinter for GUI
- PIL for image processing

## Future Improvements
1. Direct VS Code integration
2. Better error recovery
3. More reliable automation
4. Improved UI/UX
5. Better configuration management
