# Task: GUI Implementation Status and Issues
Date: 2024-11-25_17-12-00

## Task Rules
- [ ] Don't delete production systems
- [ ] Always backup before making changes
- [ ] Verify changes in staging first
- [ ] Follow security protocols
- [ ] Document all changes

## Status Summary

### Completed Features
1. Basic GUI Framework
   - Electron app with TypeScript support
   - Tab-based interface (Tasks, Credentials, Settings)
   - Custom titlebar with project selector

2. Task Management
   - Create new tasks with description and system prompt
   - Task rules management (default + custom)
   - Safety checks implementation
   - Active/archived task views
   - Task markdown generation
   - Open tasks in VS Code/default editor

3. Project Management
   - Project selection dialog
   - Project configuration storage
   - Project-specific task storage

### Issues Found
1. Button Functionality Broken
   - Possible cause: IPC handlers not properly registered
   - Missing handlers: saveKeysFile, openTaskFile
   - TypeScript errors in renderer.js

2. Task Generation Issues
   - Empty task.md files being generated
   - Task template not properly populated
   - Need to improve task file naming

3. Credential Management Issues
   - Current implementation too rigid
   - Need more flexible credential structure
   - Keys.txt template needs updating

## Required Fixes

1. IPC Communication
   ```javascript
   // Add missing handlers in main.js
   ipcMain.handle('saveKeysFile', async (event, content) => {
     // Implementation needed
   });
   
   ipcMain.handle('openTaskFile', async (event, taskId) => {
     // Implementation needed
   });
   ```

2. Task Generation
   ```javascript
   // Fix template population
   async function generateTaskMarkdown(title, rules, systemPrompt) {
     // Need to preserve template structure
     // Only replace specific placeholders
     // Keep other sections intact
   }
   ```

3. Credential Management
   ```javascript
   // Make credential structure more flexible
   // Allow custom service names
   // Dynamic field addition
   // Better keys.txt template
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Fix IPC handler registration
2. Improve task template handling
3. Implement flexible credential management
4. Add proper error handling
5. Add logging system
6. Improve type definitions

## Access Requirements
- SSH Config: N/A
- API Keys: N/A
- Permissions: Local development environment

## Safety Checks
- [x] Production safeguards active (local development only)
- [x] Backup systems verified (git version control)
- [x] Rollback plan tested (git revert available)
- [x] Access controls verified (local development)
- [x] Monitoring systems active (dev tools + logs)

## Pre-Execution Checklist
- [x] Verified environment
- [x] Checked service health
- [x] Backed up relevant data
- [x] Reviewed previous tasks
- [x] Confirmed compliance with task rules

## Steps
1. Fix IPC Communication
   ```bash
   # Update main.js with proper handlers
   # Update renderer.d.ts with proper types
   # Fix TypeScript errors
   ```

2. Fix Task Generation
   ```bash
   # Update task template handling
   # Fix markdown generation
   # Improve file naming
   ```

3. Improve Credential Management
   ```bash
   # Update keys.txt template
   # Make credential UI more flexible
   # Improve credential storage
   ```

## Verification
1. Test IPC Communication
   ```bash
   # Test all button functionality
   # Verify error handling
   ```

2. Test Task Generation
   ```bash
   # Create new task
   # Verify markdown content
   # Check file naming
   ```

3. Test Credential Management
   ```bash
   # Add custom credential
   # Import from keys.txt
   # Verify storage
   ```

## Rollback
1. Git revert to last working state
   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

## Results
- [ ] Task completed successfully
- [x] Documentation updated
- [ ] Changes verified
- [x] Rollback tested
- [x] All task rules followed

## Notes
- Historical context: Initial GUI implementation
- Known issues: Button functionality, task generation, credential management
- Future improvements: Logging system, better error handling, improved UI
