# Implement AI Model Integration

## Progress Summary

### Completed
- Added OpenRouter API integration for Claude Sonnet
- Added Perplexity API integration for search
- Implemented model selection framework
- Added cost tracking and budgeting
- Created AI model manager GUI
- Added search capabilities
- Implemented result caching

### In Progress
- Testing with live APIs
- Fine-tuning model selection
- Optimizing cost management

### Next Steps
1. Test and optimize:
   - Live API testing
   - Performance monitoring
   - Cost optimization
   - Cache tuning

2. Enhance search integration:
   - Improve context handling
   - Add search result analysis
   - Implement task suggestions
   - Add memory system

3. Add model-specific features:
   - Claude Sonnet optimizations
   - GPT-4 reasoning tasks
   - Gemini Pro bulk processing
   - Model fallback handling

## Technical Implementation

### AI Integration
```python
class ModelSelector:
    """Selects appropriate model based on task"""
    def select_model(self, task_type, input_size, budget):
        # Model selection logic
        pass

class CostTracker:
    """Tracks and manages AI costs"""
    def track_usage(self, task_id, model, tokens, cost):
        # Cost tracking logic
        pass

class SearchEngine:
    """Handles intelligent search"""
    async def search(self, query, context=None):
        # Search logic
        pass
```

### Search Integration
```python
class SearchManager:
    """Manages search operations"""
    async def search(self, query, context=None):
        # Search with model selection
        pass

    def get_history(self):
        # Get search history
        pass
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Model Selection
- Task analysis
- Cost estimation
- Performance tracking
- Budget management

### 2. Search Integration
- Query analysis
- Context handling
- Result caching
- Cost optimization

### 3. Computer Use
- Task suggestions
- Command optimization
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring

## Notes
- Focus on cost efficiency
- Use small model by default
- Cache frequently used results
- Monitor performance metrics
- Track usage patterns

## Future Improvements
1. Enhanced caching:
   - Intelligent cache invalidation
   - Result relevance scoring
   - Cache sharing between projects

2. Advanced search:
   - Multi-model search
   - Result synthesis
   - Context awareness
   - Learning from usage

3. Cost optimization:
   - Dynamic model selection
   - Budget forecasting
   - Usage analytics
   - Optimization suggestions
