# Task: Complete Cline GUI Implementation - Phase 1
Date: 2024-11-24_16-26-52

## Context
- Previous Tasks: Initial GUI setup and type system implementation
- Related Docs: PRD.md, templates/configs/keys.template
- Current State: Basic GUI running with type definitions in place

## Current Implementation Status
1. Completed Features:
   - Basic GUI structure with Electron
   - Type definitions for app, DOM, and Electron
   - Keys file parsing and validation
   - First-time setup flow
   - Project-specific configuration support
   - Basic UI components

2. Working Components:
   - Keys file integration
   - Project context management
   - Basic credential storage

## Next Steps
1. Type System Fixes:
   - Fix null checks in DOM operations
   - Add proper type annotations to parameters
   - Handle error types correctly
   - Implement proper type guards

2. Missing Functionality:
   - Implement getCurrentProject IPC handler
   - Complete credential management integration
   - Add proper error handling
   - Improve UI/UX feedback

3. Testing & Documentation:
   - Add unit tests
   - Add integration tests
   - Document API and type system
   - Create user guide

## Technical Requirements
1. Type System:
   - Fix all TypeScript errors
   - Ensure proper null checking
   - Add comprehensive type definitions
   - Implement type guards for DOM operations

2. IPC Handlers:
   - getCurrentProject
   - Project management functions
   - Credential management functions
   - Error handling wrappers

3. UI Improvements:
   - Better error messages
   - Loading states
   - Validation feedback
   - Responsive design

## Safety Checks
- [ ] Type system properly validates all operations
- [ ] Credential storage is secure
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] UI provides proper feedback
- [ ] Project context is maintained

## Verification Steps
1. Type System:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

2. Application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Tests (to be implemented):
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Notes
- Current focus is on stabilizing the type system and completing core functionality
- Need to maintain compatibility with existing Cline CLI tool
- Consider adding automated tests as part of the build process
- Document all type definitions and interfaces for future maintenance
