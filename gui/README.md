# Cline GUI

A modular GUI implementation for the Cline task management and automation system.

## Architecture

The GUI is split into several components:

- `main.py` - Main application entry point and component integration
- `security_checks.py` - Security validation and safeguards
- `vscode_automation.py` - VS Code integration and command automation
- `task_management.py` - Task creation and management
- `credential_management.py` - Credential storage and injection
- `command_history.py` - Command tracking and visualization
- `utils.py` - Common utilities and helpers

### Component Relationships

```
main.py
  ├── security_checks.py
  ├── vscode_automation.py (depends on security_checks)
  ├── task_management.py
  ├── credential_management.py
  └── command_history.py (depends on credential_management)
```

## Features

### Security Checks
- Standard security checklist
- Validation before dangerous operations
- Logging of all actions

### VS Code Automation
- Command execution through VS Code
- Automated approval of safe commands
- Security validation before actions

### Task Management
- Task creation and tracking
- Project organization
- Task template with security and credentials

### Credential Management
- Secure credential storage
- Credential injection into commands
- Integration with task system

### Command History
- Command tracking
- Visual timeline
- Output capture

## Usage

1. Run the GUI:
   ```bash
   ./run_gui.py
   ```

2. Select a project directory
3. Create or open tasks
4. Configure security checks
5. Add credentials
6. Execute commands

## Security Model

1. All dangerous operations require:
   - Security checklist verification
   - User confirmation
   - Logging of action

2. Credentials:
   - Stored in keys.txt
   - Referenced in task.md
   - Injected at runtime

3. VS Code Integration:
   - Commands validated before execution
   - Automated approval only for safe commands
   - All actions logged

## Development

1. Adding new components:
   - Create new module in gui/
   - Update __init__.py
   - Integrate in main.py

2. Security considerations:
   - Add security checks for dangerous operations
   - Log all important actions
   - Validate user input

3. Testing:
   - Test component in isolation
   - Test integration with other components
   - Verify security checks
