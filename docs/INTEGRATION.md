# Cline Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to integrate with the Cline VSCode extension, including tool execution, error handling, and recovery strategies.

## Architecture

### Components

1. VSCode Integration
- Detects and interacts with Cline extension
- Handles tool requests and responses
- Manages extension lifecycle

2. Tool Executor
- Executes tool requests safely
- Handles file operations
- Controls browser actions
- Manages system commands

3. System Integration
- Connects monitor with executor
- Handles event flow
- Manages tool lifecycle
- Provides error recovery

4. Error Recovery
- Handles error scenarios
- Implements recovery strategies
- Manages resource cleanup
- Provides retry mechanisms

### Flow Diagrams

1. Tool Request Flow
```
Extension -> Monitor -> System -> Executor -> Response
```

2. Error Recovery Flow
```
Error -> Strategy -> Action -> Retry/Cleanup -> Result
```

## Tool Types

### 1. Command Execution
```xml
<execute_command>
<command>echo "Hello World"</command>
</execute_command>
```

- Executes system commands
- Safety checks for dangerous operations
- Working directory management
- Output capture and error handling

### 2. File Operations
```xml
<write_to_file>
<path>example.txt</path>
<content>Hello World
