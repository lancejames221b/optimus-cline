  "query": "Latest methods for Gmail automation without using official API?",
  "response": "While using the official Gmail API is a powerful way to automate Gmail, there are alternative methods and tools that can help achieve automation without directly leveraging the API. Here are some of the latest methods and tools:\n\n### 1. Gmelius\nGmelius offers a range of automation features that can be integrated directly into your Gmail account. It provides tools for automating email outreach, sorting and organizing emails using filters, and synchronizing emails with Kanban boards. Gmelius also allows for automated replies, task assignments, and email routing based on specific criteria[1].\n\n### 2. Google Workspace Integrations\nGoogle Workspace offers a rich set of APIs, SDKs, and no-code/low-code tools for creating apps and integrating workflows directly into Google Workspace. Tools like Duet AI for AppSheet enable users to create intelligent business applications and build workflows into Google Workspace without coding. This includes creating Google Chat apps and integrating workflows with Chat[2].\n\n### 3. Apps Script\nGoogle Apps Script provides a built-in Gmail service that allows scripts to find and modify threads, messages, and labels in a Gmail mailbox. While it's not as advanced as the Gmail API, it's a straightforward way to automate tasks within Gmail using scripts. For example, you can list all user labels, inbox snippets, or recent history records using Apps Script[3].\n\n### 4. Rowy\nRowy is another tool that allows you to automate Gmail tasks such as sending and reading emails, as well as replying to messages. It integrates with the Gmail API but also provides a user-friendly interface for automating workflows without needing to delve into the API directly[5].\n\n### Best Practices\n- **Use Gmail Filters**: Gmail's native filters can be powerful for automating email sorting and organization.\n- **Integrate with Google Workspace**: Leverage the integrations available within Google Workspace to streamline workflows.\n- **Third-Party Tools**: Utilize third-party tools like Gmelius or Rowy that offer user-friendly interfaces for automating Gmail tasks.\n\nBy combining these methods and tools, you can effectively automate your Gmail workflows without necessarily using the official Gmail API.",
